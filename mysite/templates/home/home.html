      <h2 style="margin-left:20px;"> Q. WHAT IS THIS PAGE? </h2>
      <p style="margin:30px;"> Welcome to <b>EXIT</b> Canada's personal website! Here, you will find many utilities to help you stay proactive! First of all, you've probably noticed our
        many listings for different projects (called <b>MISSIONS</b>). Each "mission" is broken down into multiple tasks (called<b> QUESTS</b>) that are readily available to you at any time. However, while
        this website is a great opportunity for supervisors to get extra help on their owned missions, I would like to stress this job board is <b> NOT MANDATORY</b> for employees to use.
        This board is also <b> NOT A METHOD </b> for the company to review individual employee progress. This board is meant to encourage you to take a look at the different types of work available to you.
        Sure, if you want to help Chris with let's say, his new EXIT Arcade, then go ahead and do that. But our overall goal is to get you thinking about what kinds of projects you would like to see
        at this company so in the future you can create your own mission realize <b> YOUR VISION</b> here at EXIT.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-left:20px;"> Q. HOW DO I USE THIS WEBSITE? </h2>
      <p style="margin:30px;"> First of all, to use this site, you have to register an account. By registering an account, you allow yourself access to the mission list and their relevant quests. Browse
        through the different missions and their quests to see what interests you. If you find a quest that you are interested in helping with, enroll yourself in the quest by clicking the accept button.
        Make sure to consult with the mission overseer to co-ordinate the details and scope of your enrolled quests. You don't want to be halfway done when you suddenly realize that you missed a minor detail
        that requires overhauling all your work.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:30px;">
        You also might have noticed the "Experience Points Reward" along with some number of EXP. We plan on implementing features where you can spend your points on either cosmetic items or some in-browser
        RPG quest. The details will be revealed in the near future. Since we are a entertainment company, it will be something fun and exciting that captures the spirit of <b>EXIT</b>.
      </p>

      <p style="margin:30px;">
        Once you are done your quest, make sure to alert the mission overseer once again. He/she can verify the completion of the quest and then reward you the experience points on completing the task.
      </p>
